```

### Set up the form and controls.
Fill the combo boxes or other chosen controls from the arrays. You should use a for loop to loop over the arrays and add the items to the combo boxes.


















### IMPLEMANTATION -- DATA AND RECEIPT FORM
Create the variables to store the customer details.
```
Dim Name, StreetName, TownCity As String

Implement data validation to ensure no fields are empty.
